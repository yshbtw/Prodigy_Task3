# Task 03: Decision Tree Classifier for Purchase Prediction
This project focuses on building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. By using a decision tree model, we can identify and understand the key factors that influence a customer’s purchasing decisions.

# Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository - Bank Marketing Dataset Description: The Bank Marketing dataset includes information about marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The data consists of customer demographics, contact details, and behavioral information from previous campaigns. This dataset is ideal for classification tasks that aim to predict customer response to a marketing offer.

# Approach

Data Loading: Import the Bank Marketing dataset, which contains information on customers' demographic and behavioral details.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, if any, to ensure data quality. Convert categorical variables to numeric format for model compatibility. Perform feature scaling if required.

Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features impacting the purchasing decision, such as age, job type, marital status, and contact type.

Model Building: Build a decision tree classifier using the processed data. Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model’s accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to understand its performance. Visualize the decision tree structure to interpret the model’s decision-making process.

Insights Extraction: Identify the key features that have the most influence on customer purchase decisions. Use the model's output to analyze which demographic or behavioral characteristics contribute to higher purchase likelihood.

# Topics Covered
Data Cleaning: Preparing data for analysis by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Feature Selection: Identifying influential features to improve model accuracy and interpretability.
Decision Tree Modeling: Building a decision tree classifier to predict outcomes based on customer data.
Model Evaluation: Using performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the model.
Insights Extraction: Understanding the key factors that drive purchasing decisions, enabling data-driven marketing strategies.

# Usage
Download the Bank Marketing dataset from the provided link on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Place the dataset file in the project directory.
Run the classification script to train the decision tree model and evaluate its performance in predicting customer purchase behavior.

# Results
The decision tree classifier provides insights into which demographic and behavioral factors are most associated with customer purchases. By analyzing the decision tree structure, we can determine the importance of different features and identify patterns, such as: Which age groups or job types are more likely to respond positively to marketing offers. How certain behaviors, such as previous campaign responses, influence purchase likelihood. These findings can guide targeted marketing efforts and improve campaign effectiveness.
